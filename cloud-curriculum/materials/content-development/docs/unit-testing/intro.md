## 🗺️ Introduction

> Unit tests are fast running automated tests that make sure a specific part of your program works as intended. They test specific methods of a dedicated module and have a clear pass/fail condition. Unit tests are a great tool for developers to identify errors instantly even before manual testing can be done to make sure their code works. We can consider unit testing as an automated error-detect-and-prevention mechanism.

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of unit testing:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/unitTestDesign-slides/index.html?tags=java) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/unitTestDesign-slides/index.html?tags=java&showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...

    - [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Java/junit-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Java/junit-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Nodejs/mocha-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Nodejs/mocha-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: Do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
