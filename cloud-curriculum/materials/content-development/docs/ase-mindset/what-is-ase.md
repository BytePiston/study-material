# Agile Software Engineering

## What is Agile?

> Ultimately, Agile is a mindset informed by the Agile Manifestoâ€™s values and principles. Those values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty. - [agilealliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

Uncertain and turbulent environments are what we face regularly within software development projects.

So how can we adapt *Agility* in our software development process from a technical point of view?

## What is Agile Software Engineering?

Agile Software Engineering encompasses practices such as test-driven development (TDD), test isolation, refactoring, pair programming and the related tools.
These practices have many proven benefits such as increased quality on all levels, better design, more stable code lines, less integration efforts, much less maintenance efforts and even increased development speed overall.
