# Distributed Logging

<!-- TODO: Tracking cookie -->

## 🗺️ Introduction

One of the arguments against a distributed system is that it is harder to debug.
However, with a good logging infrastructure in place, compiling a full trace of your complete system's behavior is no more difficult than in a monolith system.

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module you will learn what's important in regards to logging in distributed systems and how it can be setup:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](../slides/fundamentals) ([with speaker notes](../slides/fundamentals/?showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...

    - [Java](../slides/java) ([with speaker notes](../slides/java/?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](../slides/nodejs) ([with speaker notes](../slides/nodejs/?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise for...

    - Cloud Foundry in [Java](../cloud-foundry-java) or [Node.js](../cloud-foundry-nodejs)
    - Kubernetes in [Java](../kubernetes-java) or [Node.js](../kubernetes-nodejs)
