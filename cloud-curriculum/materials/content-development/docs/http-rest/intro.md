## 🗺️Introduction
What is a web app?
>A web application (or web app) is an application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are stored locally on the Operating System (OS) of the device. Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active internet connection. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application))

What is REST used for?
>RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer))

Why would I choose REST?
>The server end of REST is stateless, which means that the server doesn't have to store anything across requests. This means that there doesn't have to be (much) communication between servers, making it horizontally scalable. (source: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11297559))

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of RESTful web services:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/httpRest-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/httpRest-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...
    - [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Java/spring-web-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Java/spring-web-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Nodejs/express-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/Nodejs/express-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
