## 🗺️ Introduction

>Test Driven Development (TDD) is an ASE practice with the purpose to lead to a solid suite of automated tests and a testable codebase. Test are always written BEFORE the corresponding production code. This gives us the possibility to identify errors or potential bugs in real time. Find more information on the [ASE Hub](https://github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/blob/master/AllLanguages/index.md#test-driven-development-tdd).

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of test-driven development:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts
    - [Slides](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/testDrivenDevelopment-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/testDrivenDevelopment-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: Do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
