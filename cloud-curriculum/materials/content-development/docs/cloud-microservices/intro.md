## 🗺️ Introduction

>In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a **suite of small services**, each **running in its own process** and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are **built around business capabilities** and **independently deployable** by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a **bare minimum of centralized management** of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
