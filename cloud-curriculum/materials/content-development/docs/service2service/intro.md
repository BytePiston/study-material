## üó∫Ô∏è Introduction

Microservices each run in their own process and therefore need to implement inter-process-communication in order to exchange data or notify one another.
A number of options exist to implement this communication, each with it's own set of tradeoffs.
In this module you will learn how to implement inter-process-communication using a RESTful HTTP resource API.

## üöÄ Get Started!
In this module, you will learn about the basics of inter-service communication:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](../slides/fundamentals) ([with speaker notes](../slides/fundamentals/?showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...
    - [Java](../slides/java) ([with speaker notes](../slides/java/?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](../slides/nodejs) ([with speaker notes](../slides/nodejs/?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
