The [developer tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools) take care of restarting the application for you after file changes.
If you suspect that your changes were not applied, make sure that all changed files have been saved and wait a few seconds for the application to restart.
If you are using an IntelliJ IDE you will need to rebuild the project (`<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>`).
