## 🗺️ Introduction

What is persistence?

>In computer science, persistence refers to the characteristic of state that outlives the process that created it. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)))

What is a database?

>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

>Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data. (source: [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database.html))

How to communicate with the database?
>The way to interact with most relational databases is SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is the most low-level form of interacting with databases. Over time developers created abstract ways of communication like Query-Builders or ORMs (Object-Relational-Mapper).

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of persistence:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](../slides/fundamentals) ([with speaker notes](../slides/fundamentals/?showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...

    - [Java](../slides/java) ([with speaker notes](../slides/java/?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](../slides/nodejs) ([with speaker notes](../slides/nodejs/?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
