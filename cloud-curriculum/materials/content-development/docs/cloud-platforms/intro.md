## üó∫Ô∏è Introduction

>Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service))

What is Cloud Computing?
>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîincluding servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence‚Äîover the Internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. (source: [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/))

## üöÄ Get Started

In this module, you will learn about the basics of cloud platforms:

1. Make yourself familiar with the concepts
    - [Slides](../slides/fundamentals) ([with speaker notes](../slides/fundamentals/?showNotes=true))
1. Learn about...
    - [Cloud Foundry](../slides/cloud-foundry) ([with speaker notes](../slides/cloud-foundry/?showNotes=true))
    - [Kubernetes](../slides/kubernetes) ([with speaker notes](../slides/kubernetes/?showNotes=true))
1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise for...
    - Cloud Foundry in [Java](../cloud-foundry-java) or [Node.js](../cloud-foundry-nodejs)
    - Kubernetes in [Java](../kubernetes-java) or [Node.js](../kubernetes-nodejs)
