# Behaviour Driven Development

<!-- TODO: count page hits -->

## 🗺️ Introduction

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is a software development process which encourages teams to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.
It combines the general principles of Test-driven development with ideas from domain-driven design to improve the collaboration of the different roles participating in software development projects.
The process is often associated with the use of specialized software tools, such as [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/).
