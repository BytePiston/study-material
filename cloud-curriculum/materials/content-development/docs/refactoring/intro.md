## 🗺️ Introduction

What is refactoring?

>Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written. (source: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code - Martin Fowler)

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of refactoring:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/refactoring-slides/index.html) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/refactoring-slides/index.html?showNotes=true))

1. Find out what constitutes "Clean Code" in...

    - [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index.html?tags=java) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index.html?tags=java&showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index.html?tags=javascript) ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index.html?tags=javascript&showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
