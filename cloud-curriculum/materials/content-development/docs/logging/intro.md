## 🗺️ Introduction

What are logs actually? How to define a log in software-context?

>An application log is a file of events that are logged by a software application. It contains errors, informational events and warnings. The format and content of an application log are determined by the developer of the software program, rather than the OS. (source: [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1819/application-log))

Why are logs so valuable?

>A well designed logging system is a huge utility for system administrators and developers, especially the support team. Logs save many valuable hours for both the support team or developers. As users execute programs at the front end, the system invisibly builds a vault of event information (log entries) for system administrators and the support team.

## 🚀 Get Started!

In this module, you will learn about the basics of logging:

1. Make yourself familiar with the general concepts

    - [Slides](../slides/fundamentals) ([with speaker notes](../slides/fundamentals/?showNotes=true))

1. Learn how it is done in...
    - [Java](../slides/java) ([with speaker notes](../slides/java/?showNotes=true))
    - [Node.js](../slides/nodejs) ([with speaker notes](../slides/nodejs/?showNotes=true))

1. Get your hands dirty: do the exercise in [Java](../java/) or in [Node.js](../nodejs/)
